Reversed aiml is part of the charlix Project

Largely inspired by a tutorial by gary Dubuque:
Dynamically Learning AIML http://209.168.21.76/AIMLpad/Learning.htm

A completly new aiml file. For a plain english sentense, 
a bunch of probable questions will be printed in the answers.  

The most compatible interpreter (for development) I tested was Libaiml. Insert the the aiml file in the directory test-app/aiml.
It should work just as nicely with the last Qaiml too. create a folder inside the directory aiml. Insert the the aiml file in it.
It should work with the last Rebecca. Insert the the aiml file in the directory aiml/annoted-alice.
